Here are some notes that explain the reason for some of the non-standard looking changes made in the grammar. Most of these are to facilitate building AST in the correcto form.

JJTree:
------

* For things like:
    int ARRAY[10]
  that are suffxies on other valid entities - ARRAY[10] is a suffix for a valid basic type 'int' -  we need to pop the node for
  the the int that's already on the stack first before making the tree for the array.

* #Unsupported is used to build special AST node of kind Unsupported so we can have the full grammar in the source and handle unsupported features gracefully.


Javacc:
------

* a -> b is potentially ambiguous as SQL allows pointer like member access using -> which conflicts with Presto lambda. we need to
